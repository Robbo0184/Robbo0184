# Hi my name is Rob, welcome to my GitHub page. 

## About Me:

I come from Scotland, I've been living in Germany since November 2014. I have been learning Web Development since 2021, up until August 2023 I had been learning online. I have completed a couple of Web Development courses on Udemy, one being a general Web Development course covering HTML, CSS, Javascript, Databases (MongoDb), NodeJS, ExpressJS and other technologies and the second course was specifically looking at JavaScript, going into detail on topics such as the basic foundations of Javascript, asynchronous Javascript, promises and more.

I am currently taking part in a Full Time Web Development boot camp in Berlin where I look to deepen my knowledge of Web Development and learn modern cutting edge technologies.
